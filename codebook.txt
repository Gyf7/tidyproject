Code book for tidy project
Subject : (1-30)
	Represent 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years, who performed activities in this experiment

Activities 
: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
	Activity that volunteers perform while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist

Variables : 
Time : These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz
frequency : Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing
acc : features data from accelerometer
gyr : features data from 3-axial gyroscope
mean : mean
std : standard deviation
jerk : the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals
